# Text-base-calculator

## Description
This is a simple text-based calculator implemented in Python. It can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator takes input from the user in the form of expressions and evaluates them.

## Features
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)

## Usage
To use the calculator, simply run the script and enter expressions in the format: `operand1 operator operand2`. For example:
```
3 + 4
```
The calculator will evaluate the expression and print the result. To exit the calculator, type `quit`.

## Functions
### `add(a, b)`
Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.

### `subtract(a, b)`
Returns the difference of `a` and `b`.

### `multiply(a, b)`
Returns the product of `a` and `b`.

### `divide(a, b)`
Returns the division of `a` by `b`. Raises `ValueError` if `b` is zero.

### `calculate(expression)`
Evaluates a basic arithmetic expression.
- **Args**: `expression (str)`: The arithmetic expression to evaluate.
- **Returns**: `float`: The result of the arithmetic operation.
- **Raises**: `ValueError`: If the expression is invalid.

## Running the Script
To run the calculator script, use the following command:
```
python calculator.py
```

### Example
```
$ python calculator.py
Text-based Calculator
Enter expressions in the format: operand1 operator operand2 (e.g., 3 + 4)
Type 'quit' to exit the calculator.
Enter expression: 10 + 5
Result: 15.0
Enter expression: 10 / 0
Error evaluating expression: Division by zero is not allowed.
Enter expression: quit
```

## Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling for:
- Invalid format: Ensures the expression is in the correct format.
- Unsupported operators: Only supports `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
- Division by zero: Raises a `ValueError` if the denominator is zero.
